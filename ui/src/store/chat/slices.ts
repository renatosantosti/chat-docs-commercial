    During my career, I worked in different industries and with different approaches to solving problems. So, I am flexible, innovative, and fast-paced to learn new things. 
    I feel free to explore new things and jump to another new technology whenever it is needed or I will explore it.
    I THINK SOLUTION IS MORE THAN TECHNOLOGIES - SO TECH IS TOOLS TO BE USED AND COMBINED TO ACHIEVE A SMART SOLUTION.
    Be an expert is good, I am an expert whenever I have been working for a long time with certain stuff, but I am always ready to explore new things, thatÂ´s my spirit. Sorry to stop your flow! 
    Go ahead, ask something to the doc!`,
